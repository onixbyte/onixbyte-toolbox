/**
 * {@code TokenPayload} interface is used to mark a data class as suitable
 * for being used as the payload in a JSON Web Token (JWT). Any class
 * implementing this interface can be used to represent the payload data that
 * will be included in a JWT.
 * <p>
 * Implementing this interface indicates that the data class contains
 * information that needs to be securely transmitted and verified as part of a
 * JWT. The payload typically contains claims or attributes that provide
 * additional information about the JWT subject or context.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * To use a class as a JWT payload, simply implement the {@code TokenPayload}
 * interface in the data class:
 * <pre>
 * public class UserData implements TokenPayload {
 *     // Class implementation with payload data...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @author Zihlu Wang
