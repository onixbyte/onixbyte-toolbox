/**
 * The {@link ObjectMapAdapter} interface provides methods to convert between objects and maps.
 * This interface is useful for scenarios where objects need to be represented as maps for
 * serialization, deserialization, or other purposes.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface should provide the logic to convert an object of type
 * {@code T} to a {@link Map} and vice versa.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example usage:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class User {
 *     private String name;
 *     private int age;
 *     
 *     // getters and setters
 * }
 * 
 * public class UserMapAdapter implements ObjectMapAdapter<User> {
 *     @Override
 *     public Map<String, Object> toMap(User user) {
 *         Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
 *         map.put("name", user.getName());
 *         map.put("age", user.getAge());
 *         return map;
 *     }
 * 
 *     @Override
 *     public User fromMap(Map<String, Object> map) {
 *         User user = new User();
 *         user.setName((String) map.get("name"));
 *         user.setAge((Integer) map.get("age"));
 *         return user;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
