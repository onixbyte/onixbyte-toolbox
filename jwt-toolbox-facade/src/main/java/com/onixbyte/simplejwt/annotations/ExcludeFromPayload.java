/**
 * Annotation {@code ExcludeFromPayload} is used to mark a property of a data
 * class that should be excluded from being automatically injected into the
 * JSON Web Token (JWT) payload during token generation. When a property is
 * annotated by this annotation, it will not be included in the JWT payloads.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * To exclude a property from the JWT payload, annotate the property with
 * {@code @ExcludeFromPayload}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class UserData implements TokenPayload {
 *     private String username;
 *
 *     // This property will not be included in the JWT payload
 *     @ExcludeFromPayload
 *     private String sensitiveData;
 *
 *     // Getters and setters...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * This annotation should be used on properties that are not intended to
 * be included in the JWT payload due to their sensitive nature or for other
 * reasons only. It is important to carefully choose which properties are
 * excluded from the payload to ensure the JWT remains secure and efficient.
